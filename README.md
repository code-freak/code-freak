Code FREAK is an online IDE for educational purposes that allows teachers to create and enroll programming tasks
allows students to programm and execute their code without leaving the browser. Submissions can be evaluated
automatically by various testing-methods like unit tests or code smell detection.

## ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️
Code FREAK is currently under heavy development. This means things can break without any further notice.
Please keep this in mind when testing the application.

## Development environment setup

1) Set up a database (optional). Currently, drivers for PostgreSQL are included. You can also use the embedded in-memory database.
2) Create a file `src/main/resources/application-dev.properties`. For documentation on how to configure the
   server see [application.properties](https://github.com/code-freak/code-freak/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties)
   in the same directory. Minimum configuration that uses the in-memory database:
   ```
   spring.jpa.database=HSQL
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
   ```
3) Run the command `./gradlew bootRun`. The application is started at http://localhost:8080.

### Fix linting issues
    ./gradlew spotlessApply
